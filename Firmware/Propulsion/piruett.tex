\N{1}{1}Introduction. This is the firmware portion of the propulsion system for
our
Champbot.
It features separate thrust and steering as well as piruett turning.

This will facilitate motion by taking ``thrust'' and ``radius'' pulse-width,
or PWC, inputs from the Futaba-Kyosho RC receiver and converting them to the
appropriate motor actions.
Thrust is Channel 2, entering analog input A1, and Radius is channel 1, at A0.
The action will be similar to driving an RC car or boat.
By keeping it natural, it should be easier to navigate the course than with a
skid-steer style control.

We are using the Wingxing DBH-01 (B/C).
The Inputs are unique on this as the PWM logic input is a two bit value applied
at terminals IN1 and IN2.
Taking IN1 as LSb and IN2 as MSb values 0 and 3 are logic LOW for the PWM.
A value of 1 is logic high in one direction and a value of 2 is logic high in
the other.

The odd example in the datasheet has PWM on IN1 and LOW on IN2 for forward.
For reverse, LOW on IN1 and PWM on IN2.
We don't want PWM hopping between pins so we keep PWM on IN1.
The result of this mode is that PWM as IN1 is inverted when IN2 is HIGH.
This means we need to invert the PWM when the direction pin goes HIGH.

The larboard motor PWM word will be available at Pins 3 and 5.
The starboard motor PWM word will be at 4 and 6.
OC0A and OC0B is on pins 5 and 6  (D8 and D6) and are the PWM.
A fail-safe relay output will be at pin 8.

\fi

\N{1}{2}Implementation.
The Futaba receiver has two PWC channels.
The pulse-width from the receiver is at 20~ms intervals.
The on-time ranges from 1000--2000~$\mu$s including trim.
1500~$\mu$s is the pulse-width for stop.
The levers cover $\pm$400~$\mu$s and the trim covers the last 100~$\mu$s.

The median time will be subtracted from them for a pair of signed values
thrust and radius. The value will be scaled.

The thrust and radius will be translated to power to the
port and starboard motors.
When near median the motors will be disabled through a dead-band.
Stiction in the motor probably wouldn't allow it to move anyway, at this low
duty-cycle. Both the PWM and safety relay will open.
The motors will also be disabled when there are no input pulses; in this way
champ wont run-off if the range is exceeded. This function is handled by the
watchdog timer.

The radius control will also be the rotate control, if thrust is zero.
Timer-Counter 0 is used for the PWM.

The ATmega328 has a 16 bit PWMs with two comparators, Timer 1.
This has an ``Input Capture Unit'' that may be used for PWC decoding.
PWC being the type of signal from the RC receiver.
That seems like as elegant a solution as I will find and it is recommended by
Atmel to use it for this purpose.

The best way to use this nice feature is to
take the PWC signals into the MUX, through the comparator and into the Input
Capture Unit.

For the PWC measurement, this app note, AVR135, is helpful:
www.atmel.com/images/doc8014.pdf


In the datasheet, this section is helpful: 16.6.3

An interesting thing about this Futaba receiver is that the pulses are in
series.
The channel two's pulse is first, followed the channel one.
In fact, channel two's fall is perfectly aligned with channel one's rise.
This means that it will be possible to capture all of the pulses.

After the two pulses are captured, there's an 18~ms dead-time before the next
round. That's over 250,000 clock cycles.
This will provide ample time to do math and set the motor PWMs.


Extensive use was made of the datasheet, Atmel
``Atmel-8271I-AVR- ATmega-Datasheet\_10/2014''.

I originaly wanted to use the word "Port" for the left-hand side, when facing
the front. On a microcontroller that name is used for all of the ports so I
chose the older word ``larboard''.

The Futaba receiver leads with channel two, rising edge, so we will start
looking for that by setting \PB{\.{"edge"}} to look for a rise on channel 2.

Center position of the controller results in a count of about 21250,
hard left, or up, with trim reports about 29100 and hard right, or down,
with trim reports about 13400.

About 4/5ths of that range are the full swing of the stick, without trim.
This is from about 14970 and 27530 ticks.

\PB{\.{".minIn"}} \PB{\.{".maxIn"}} are the endpoints of the normal stick
travel.
The units are raw counnts as the Input Capture Register will use.

At some point a calibration feature could be added which could populate these
but the numbers here were from trial and error and seem good.

Until we have collected the edges we will assume there is no signal.

Rather than burning loops, waiting the ballance of 18~ms for something to
happen, the \PB{\.{"sleep"}} mode is used.
The specific type of sleep is \PB{\.{"idle"}}.
In idle, execution stops but timers, like the Input Capture Unit and PWM
continue to operate.
Interrupts, either \PB{\\{Input}\\{Capture}} or \PB{\\{Watchdog}},  are used to
wake it up.

It's important to note that an ISR procedure must be defined to allow the
program to step past the sleep statement, even if it is empty.
This stumped me for a good while.

Since \PB{\.{"edge"}} is already set, calling \PB{\\{edgeSelect}(\,)} will get
it ready for
the first rising edge of channel~2.
Subsequent calls to \PB{\\{edgeSelect}} rotates it to the next edge type.

Now that a loop is started, the PWM is value and we wait in
\PB{\.{"idle"}} for the edge on the channel selected. Each sucessive loop will

If execution arrives here, some interrupt has woken it from sleep and some
vector has possibly run. The possibility is first checked.
The pointer \PB{\.{"handleIrq"}} will be assigned the value of the responsible
function and then executed.
After that the IRQ is nulled so as to avoid repeating the action, should it
wake for some other reason.

This is not really an efficient method, recomputing gain and offset every time

I don't have to manualy compute and enter these value.

We need a way to translate \PB{\.{"thrust"}} and \PB{\.{"radius"}} in order to
carve a
\PB{\.{"turn"}}. This procedure should do this but it's not going to be perfect
as
drag and slippage make thrust increase progressivly more than speed.
Since \PB{\\{speed}} is not known, we will use \PB{\\{thrust}}.
It should steer OK as long as the speed is constant and small changes in speed
should not be too disruptive.

Here we convert desired radius to thrust-difference by scaling to speed.
Then that difference is converted to rotation by scaling it with \PB{%
\.{"track"}}.
The radius sensitivity is adjusted by changing the value of \PB{\.{"track"}}.

Any rotation involves one motor turning faster than the other.
At some point, faster is not possible and so the requiered clipping is here.

\PB{\.{"max"}} is set at to support the limit of the bridge-driver's
charge-pump.

If there is no thrust then it is in piruett mode and spins CW or CCW.

This simple procedure sets the signal to the H-Bridge.
The MSb at termonal IN1 sets the direction.
The LSb is the PWM.
For the PWM we load the positive or negative value into the unsigned registers.
If it is negative the PWM is inverted, which happens to work well for this
H-Bridge.

PWM setup isn't too scary.
Timer Count 0 is configured for ``Phase Correct'' PWM which, according to the
datasheet, is preferred for motor control.
OC0A (port) and OC0B (starboard) are set to clear on a match which creates a
non-inverting PWM.
The prescaler is set to clk/8 and with a 16 MHz clock the $f$ is about 3922 Hz.
