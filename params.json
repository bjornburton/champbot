There are parts from several appliances, including a dehumidifier, computer-monitor, power-drills and various building materials.\r\n\r\nThe design is far from any boat or sub, having more in common with a compact, mobile buoy. It would be difficult to have less consideration for hydrodynamics, aside from raising up from the water when under-way.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Specifications\r\n* Launched on September 12, 2015 in Arrowhead Lake, East Georgia Vt.\r\n* Type: Competition ROV, ChampBot\r\n\r\n## Construction Features\r\n * Dual Hull, Over/Under, joined by 4 stanchions\r\n * Dual Drive Units on a pivoting drive-boom\r\n * Microwave spread-spectum remote for an improved look (NEW for 2016)\r\n * MOSFET dual motor drive with electronic braking (Improved for 2016)\r\n * Radius computer with providing single-stick control and piruett turning\r\n * Autonymous dive including DDC control loop\r\n    to maintain precise depth for an exact time (NEW for 2016)\r\n * Rotary Dive-Planes for rapid diving\r\n * Jaw control for an \"authentic\" float drop\r\n * Fire from the mouth, just as it should be\r\n\r\n## Payload\r\n* 1x float, 20 cm from water surface\r\n\r\n## Dimensions \r\n* Length: 96 cm\r\n* Beam: 70 cm\r\n* Draft: 30 cm (flank), 40 cm (stopped)\r\n* Height: 83 cm\r\n* Displacement Weight 9.2 kg\r\n \r\n## Main Propulsion\r\n* 2x Johnson Electric motors with B&D reduction gears and chucks\r\n* Power: 0.6 kW (0.8 HP) (estimated)\r\n* Propellers: 2x, 23 cm diameter, 10 cm pitch\r\n* Max Speed: 3 kph (1.62 knots) (estimated)\r\n\r\n## Power\r\n* 5 Ah, 12.6 V AGM\r\n * 30 Amp, self-resetting breaker \r\n  \r\n## Armament\r\n* 1x 100+ kW PFI (Projected Flame Igniter) (Improved output for 2016)\r\n * 70/30 Butane/Propane at 2.6 Bar (NEW for 2016)\r\n * Water-heated, large-surface evaporator (NEW for 2016)\r\n * Multi-spark, capacitive discharge pre-ignitor (NEW for 2016)\r\n * 5 mm orifice with guard horn (NEW for 2016)\r\n * 30 second capacity (3.6 MJ) \r\n\r\nHere are the 2016 Champbot Challenge results.\r\nThe list is not yet in point order.\r\n\r\nDo not look bellow.\r\n\r\n|Place|=Team|=Design|=Time|=Other|=Total|\r\n|1st|[[iBots|http://rutlandarearobotics.org]]|unknown|unknown|unknown|unknown|\r\n|unknown|[[Champlain College MakerLab|http://www.champlain.edu/centers-of-excellence/emergent-media-center/makerlab]]|471|125|40|636|\r\n|unknown|Team Jadus|260|175|0|435|\r\n|unknown|Team Burton|371||50|421|\r\n|unknown|foam Boat/Samuel & Dee Champlain|415|||415|\r\n|unknown|The Burtons (That's Us!)|400|||400|\r\n|unknown|Monster Makers|185|150|50|385|\r\n|unknown|[[Robots 4 Kids|http://www.r4k2.com/]]|345|||345|\r\n|unknown|unknown|340|||340|\r\n\r\nHere are the 2015 Champbot Challenge results (cribbed from http://emergentmedia.champlain.edu/2015/10/10/a-champbot-a-battle-a-victory/ ).
