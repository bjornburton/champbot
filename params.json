{"name":"ChampBot-2015","tagline":"A Champ-like ROV, with brief submersion capability, designed to meet the demands of the Champlain Mini Maker Faire's ChampBot Challenge  of 2015","body":"Looking part Tanystropheus, part Gungan and sporting a wicked pair of drive-units on a pivoting boom, this bot is Done!\r\n![ChampBot](https://github.com/bjornburton/champbot/blob/master/pictures/final.jpg?raw=true)\r\n\r\nThe head is made of a license plate and the eyes are made of ping-pong balls lit by red LEDs. There are parts from several appliances, including a dehumidifier and computer-monitor.\r\n\r\nThe design is far from any boat or sub, having more in common with a compact, mobile buoy. It would be difficult to have less consideration for hydrodynamics, aside from raising up from the water when under-way.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we did not complete any of the four challenges. We are disappointed but we were in good company of strong teams that, for want of a bit of luck, could have taken the prize. Between that, and the fun along the way, we don't consider it a loss, as a whole. If there is a ChampBot Challenge for 2016 we may be back.\r\n\r\nWhat's next?\r\n\r\n\r\n# Specifications\r\n* Launched on September 12, 2015 in Arrowhead Lake, East Georgia Vt.
