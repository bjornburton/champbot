There are parts from several appliances, including a dehumidifier, computer-monitor, power-drills and various building materials.\r\n\r\nThe design is far from any boat or sub, having more in common with a compact, mobile buoy. It would be difficult to have less consideration for hydrodynamics, aside from raising up from the water when under-way.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Specifications\r\n* Launched on September 12, 2015 in Arrowhead Lake, East Georgia Vt.\r\n* Type: Competition ROV, ChampBot\r\n\r\n## Construction Features\r\n * Dual Hull, Over/Under, joined by 4 stanchions\r\n * Dual Drive Units on a pivoting drive-boom\r\n * Microwave spread-spectum remote for an improved look (NEW for 2016)\r\n * MOSFET dual motor drive with electronic braking (Improved for 2016)\r\n * Radius computer with providing single-stick control and piruett turning\r\n * Autonymous dive including DDC control loop\r\n    to maintain precise depth for an exact time (NEW for 2016)\r\n * Rotary Dive-Planes for rapid diving\r\n * Jaw control for an \"authentic\" float drop\r\n * Fire from the mouth, just as it should be\r\n\r\n## Payload\r\n* 1x float, 20 cm from water surface\r\n\r\n## Dimensions \r\n* Length: 96 cm\r\n* Beam: 70 cm\r\n* Draft: 30 cm (flank), 40 cm (stopped)\r\n* Height: 83 cm\r\n* Displacement Weight 9.2 kg\r\n \r\n## Main Propulsion\r\n* 2x Johnson Electric motors with B&D reduction gears and chucks\r\n* Power: 0.6 kW (0.8 HP) (estimated)\r\n* Propellers: 2x, 23 cm diameter, 10 cm pitch\r\n* Max Speed: 3 kph (1.62 knots) (estimated)\r\n\r\n## Power\r\n* 5 Ah, 12.6 V AGM\r\n * 30 Amp, self-resetting breaker \r\n  \r\n## Armament\r\n* 1x 100+ kW PFI (Projected Flame Igniter) (Improved output for 2016)\r\n * 70/30 Butane/Propane at 2.6 Bar (NEW for 2016)\r\n * Water-heated, large-surface evaporator (NEW for 2016)\r\n * Multi-spark, capacitive discharge pre-ignitor (NEW for 2016)\r\n * 5 mm orifice with guard horn (NEW for 2016)\r\n * 30 second capacity (3.6 MJ) \r\n\r\n\r\n",
